 ## Project Structure and Functionalities (Page Wise)
 1. Homepage:  
  On the homepage, we focus on making things look nice and easy to use. At the bottom of the navigation bar, you'll find icons for important actions like logging in, registering, and logging out. This makes it simple for you to find and use these features whenever you need them.
  
 2. Dashboard:
 
    The dashboard page is the heart of this project. It's a private route, meaning only logged-in users can access it. On this page, users can do several things: add, edit, and delete tasks. When a user creates a task, it initially goes into the pending section. From there, users can move tasks to the ongoing or complete sections. Users can also filter their tasks by clicking on the filter section, where they'll see options to choose how they want to filter their tasks.
